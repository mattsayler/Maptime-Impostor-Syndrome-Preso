# What is Impostor Syndrome?

---

## Originally coined by clinical psychologists Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes

---

## **"** Collection of feelings of inadequacy even in the face of evidence to the contrary **"**

---

## Not considered a psychological disorder

---

## BUT over time anxiety and depression, often associated with it, can reach clinical levels

---

# Other Downsides<br/>

## 1. Don't apply for jobs
## 2. Muted voice
## 3. Stymied ambition

---

# Different Categories<br/>

## 1. Feeling like a fake
## 2. Attributing successes to luck/timing
## 3. Discounting successes
